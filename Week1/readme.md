> Network simulators attempt to model real world networks. The idea being that if a system can be modeled, then features of the model can be changed and the results analyzed. As the process of model modification is relatively cheap then a wide variety of scenarios can be analyzed at low cost (relative to making changes to a real network).

 > NS2 (Network Simulator 2):  
It is a discrete event simulator that provides substantial support for simulation of TCP, routing, and multicast protocols over wired and wireless networks.  
It use C++ and OTcl languages.  
Sample ns2 code. In which there are four different nodes are available and two different routers.

>WHY NETWORK SIMULATOR?  
Making changes to your network are expensive. Mistakes can cost you a lot of money to rectify.  
If you had a tool that allowed you to model your current network, then make changes to it to see what happened.  
 That would be useful wouldnt it? The network simulator would remove some of the uncertainty surrounding the changes you were making. Of course, it wont remove all of the uncertainty, but at least it will remove some of it.

 > WHY ns-3  
 first of all it is accepted by everyone while writing reasearch papers  
 second it is the latest version of ns  
 ns-3 can acts as a simulator and emulator both  
 c++ is sufficient to work with ns-3

> WIRESHARK  - Wireshark is a network packet analyzer. A network packet analyzer will try to capture network packets and tries to display that packet data as detailed as possible.  
These are other packet analyser    
TCPDUMP, gnuplot, PyViz.  
 NetAnim  -  offline animator

>WHAT IS WAF  
waf is a python-based build tool.

...

> WSCRIPT  
Windows Script Host provides an environment in which users can execute scripts in a variety of languages that use a variety of object models to perform tasks.

...  

>helper classes vs containers  

> CALLBACKS  -  A callback is a function that is to be executed after another function has finished executing.

...

>SMART POINTER  
Using smart pointers, we can make pointers to work in way that we don’t need to explicitly call delete.    
Since destructor is automatically called when an object goes out of scope, the dynamically allocated memory would automatically deleted.

>FLOW MONITOR  
The Flow Monitor module goal is to provide a flexible system to measure the performance of network protocols.  
he module uses probes, installed in network nodes, to track the packets exchanged by the nodes, and it will measure a number of parameters. Packets are divided according to the flow they belong to, where each flow is defined according to the probe’s characteristics (e.g., for IP, a flow is defined as the packets with the same {protocol, source (IP, port), destination (IP, port)} tuple.
